## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]


### Prerequisites

We had as end of year project, a functional e-commerce website in Php, mySql.
I decided to create a Lego sales site, Brickit!     <br />


On the site, there are several user-side features such as: add products to cart and place an order.
I created a game like Pacman where it is possible to choose his hero!     <br />


On the administrator side, there is the possibility to add, edit and delete categories, products and users.
There is also a traceability of user orders with the ability to see all the details of an order.     <br />


Download Brickit and send me a message, I will answer you with joy ! <br />
